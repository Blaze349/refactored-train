# Investigating - 15 Dec 2017

### General Information

Topic:*The relationship between physical, virtual and abstract computing components*
Research Question: *How do physical and virtual subsystems combine to form an optimal programming environment?*

Goal: My goal is to provide the programming community with tools to improve software development through a custom environment comprised of customised hardware, a customised operating system and a custom programming language.

Global Context: Scientific and technical innovation
For my global context I was originally split between doing *personal and cultural expression* and *scientific and technical innovation*. I had considered doing 'metacognition and abstract thinking' since programming falls under abstract thinking. However, I realised that this context didn't encompass my entire project but rather just a small subsection. After this, I looked at the Scientific and Technical Innovation context since Computer (Technology) Science (scientific) fits under the context. From here, I chose the models/systems/processes subcategory since it best matched my topic.

Personal Interest in Project:

### Questions

TODO: Add approaches to learning

- What type of information will I include?

- How will I present the information?

- Will I include visuals?

- Do I need to consider any copyright or intellectual property issues? â–ª Who is the audience?

> GNU/Linux and its deriatives are automatically under the GNU Public License, which is a copyleft license. This license places a large emphasis on **freedom** (free as in speech) and power to the the user. It entails that all source code must be made somewhat available to the user, so that the user may modify however they decide to. Apart from these requirements, there aren't really any issues that I need to consider. 
> 
> The audience, as in the spirit of GNU/Linux, is anyone who wishes to empower themselves and use *free* software.

- How will I get feedback?

> I can get surface level feedback by asking people around me to try the system. However to get deeper feedback, I'd have to mostly rely on my own experience and other people who may decide to go throw the hassle of installing a new operating system. It'd be relatively easy to get feedback for the programming language since it should be easy to install.


### What do I already know?

I recently wrote an emulator, replicating the computer system of the Intel 8080, to interface instructions for the 8080 with my operating system. During this process, I gained a better understanding of how the kernel interfaces various computer components together to create a system capable of executing code on the fly. I've used many operating systems via manual installation or through virtualization and have learned what aspects I enjoy in an operating system.I know how to program using low-level languages as well as create scripts. I know how to use a Unix shell. This will be helpful in creating an operating system since that requires effective configuration and specialised scripts.

I know about programming paradigmns such as object-oriented, functional and imperative programming. I'm know how to program in several programming languages including C, C++, MIT Scheme, Javascript and Swift. I know about compilers and interpreters and I have a shallow understanding about how code is compiled/interpreted and executed. This will be will be helpful to my project because it means I don't have to start from scratch and learn how to do basic programming, before learning to efficiently program for more complex problems.

### Justification (Why these parts were chosen)

These parts were chosen using the website au.pcpartpicker.com.

### Why I'm Using Arch Linux As My Base - 27 Jan 2018

*Upon careful consideration and research, I've decided to use Arch Linux as the base for my operating system.*

An important aspect in creating an optimal programming environment is the actual virtual virtual environment. The operating system manages processes, memory usage and input/output streams. It's composed of various programs that interlock together to control usage of hardware. There were a number of methods I considered for creating my operating system.

### Entirely hand-written system from scratch

This would entail me personally writing the code for everything including the kernel, shell, etc. This was honestly the most ridiculous route I could choose. Operating Systems such as Ubuntu or Windows are the combined effort of thousands of developers over several decades. To individually write all the components that compose these OS would take much longer than 6 months, probably much longer than a human lifespan. While I could knock up something that somewhat fits the specification of an OS in 6 months, it would be rather barebones, unreliable and unable to dependably run on my hardware. And since I'm actually planning to use the operating system, that would be unsatisfactory.

### Individually Assemble Components (aka Linux From Scratch)

A few years ago, I came across a project designed to promote familiarity with the GNU/Linux subsystems. It's called Linux From Scratch and is comprised of resources that slowly guide the user to assembling their own GNU/Linux system through a rather complex yet simple set of steps. I was originally leaning toward this pathway however there were two complications that I foresaw. 

0. There would be no prebuilt binaries for this system
1. There would be no package manager. At least with a sizable userbase that would contribute packages.

Problem No.0 means that all software on the system has to be separately compiled. Depending on the complexity of the code, how many executables I have to compile and the speed of my system this could take several hours, which is certainly not **optimal**. This is the same problem with a similar GNU/Linux distro known as Gentoo in which source code most be compiled by the user. 

Problem No.1 is similar to the first problem in that installation would be made more difficult than it needs to be. A good package manager automatically handles dependencies and version collision. It makes it easy to install, remove or distribute software. It can quickly become a nightmare to handle thousands of dependencies by hand. While I could install a package manager with the LFS system, it would miss the most important advantage of a package manager, *packages*.


### Using an existing distro as a base

Because of issues 0 and 1, I wasn't sure how to proceed. I wanted the customizability and specialised vibe of a handmade system while also desiring the usability and reliability of an ubiquitous system such as Debian or Fedora. I realised I could build upon an existing distribution to take advantage of it's package manager. The only issue was whether the creation would count as a custom GNU/Linux operating system however I observed that many GNU/Linux distributions or operating systems I had encountered where actually built upon pre-existing distributions. Some notable examples of this are:

* Ubuntu, the beginner-friendly remix of Debian
* Manjaro, the easier to deal with version of Arch Linux
* Linux Mint, a Ubuntu-based operating system

The only thing left was to choose which distribution use. I wanted something relatively light-weight, that afforded customizability and had a powerful package-manager. This left me with Arch Linux which somewhat allows me to assemble my own packages, therefore allowing me to prevent bloat and comes with the iconic *pacman* package manager as well as the support of the extensive *Arch User Repository* or AUR.

### Constructing The Computer - 30 March 2018

![PC Parts]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/pcbuilding1.jpg)

Computer construction involves the connection and linkage of several electrical parts in order to form a functional Turing machine. This build was made up of various parts designed to maximise performance and compatibility while decreasing cost: 
* Central Processing Unit - Intel Core i7-8700
* CPU Coolers - Deepcool GAMMAXX 400, Intel Stock Cooler, Hyper 212 Evo
* Motherboard - Asus Prime Z370
* RAM - 2 x Ripjaws V 8gb
* Storage - Crucial MX300 1TB SSD
* Case - NZXT S340 Elite
* Fans - Aer RGB 120mm, 140mm
* Graphics Card - Asus Geforce 1070
* Power Supply - Corsair TX550M
* Other Accessories - NZXT Hue+ and Deepcool Fanhub

Equipment used:

* Non-static workbench
* A Phillips screwdriver
* Pliers (I can't remember if I used this but anyways)


### Connecting Basic System

The first step in building the computer is assembling the core components on the motherboard. This allows us to check whether our parts are faulty or incompatible. It will allow us to boot up the initial system and to check that everything posts.

| Installing the CPU | Installing RAM |
| --- | --- |
| ![PC Parts]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/pcbuilding2.jpg) | ![PC Parts]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/pcbuilding3.jpg) |

To install these: First remove the motherbox from its protective casing and lay it on a non-static workbench. The makeshift workbench used in the picture is simply the motherboard box. Check the motherboard for any obvious defects such as bent socket pins before installing the components. To install the CPU: Open up the CPU cover and remove the CPU from its box, avoiding touching sensitive areas. Align the CPU so that it is correctly oriented with the CPU socket, using the bottom-left triangle for reference. Gently place the CPU into the socket and close it.
Next, open the latches for the RAM slots and push in the RAM sticks according to the optimal layout in the motherboard manual. Press down firmly until the latches snap back up.

After this, we must install the CPU cooler. Squirt a small dollop of thermal paste on the centre of the CPU. This will spread out in an uniform fashion, allowing for efficient heat-transfer between the cooler and CPU. Based on what CPU and motherboard you have, use the appropriate pins to install the cooler. Finish by plugging the cooler into the CPU_FAN socket.

The last component to be installed is the GPU. This will only be temporarily installed as it has to be reinstalled separately in the case. Similarly to the RAM, pop open the PCLE slot, push in the GPU and connect it to a monitor.
Before booting up we need to connect the electronics to a power supply **TODO TOMORROW**

Finally, we can start up the system by shorting the PWR pins with a metal object. If everything was done correctly and all parts are functional, then the BIOS should successfully boot.

### Installing System In Case

Now that we have confirmed the parts are functional and compatible, they need to be permanently fixed in their chassis.
