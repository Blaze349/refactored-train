Computer construction involves the connection and linkage of several electrical parts in order to form a functional Turing machine. This build was made up of various parts designed to maximise performance and compatibility while decreasing cost. These are the parts (for a more indepth list and justification click [here](https://blaze349.github.io/refactored-train/2018/01/03/PC-Final-Part-List.html)):

* Central Processing Unit - Intel Core i7-8700
* CPU Coolers - Deepcool GAMMAXX 400, Intel Stock Cooler, Hyper 212 Evo
* Motherboard - Asus Prime Z370
* RAM - 2 x Ripjaws V 8gb
* Storage - Crucial MX300 1TB SSD
* Case - NZXT S340 Elite
* Fans - Aer RGB 120mm, 140mm
* Graphics Card - Asus Geforce 1070
* Power Supply - Corsair TX550M
* Other Accessories - NZXT Hue+ and Deepcool Fanhub

### Step 1: Connecting Basic System

The first step in building the computer is assembling the core components on the motherboard. This allows us to check whether our parts are faulty or incompatible. It will allow us to boot up the initial system and to check that everything posts.
