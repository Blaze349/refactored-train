This post outlines the construction of the computer.

Computer construction involves the connection and linkage of several electrical parts in order to form a functional Turing machine. This build was made up of various parts designed to maximise performance and compatibility while decreasing cost. These are the parts (for a more indepth list and justification click [here](https://blaze349.github.io/refactored-train/2018/01/03/PC-Final-Part-List.html)):

* Central Processing Unit - Intel Core i7-8700
* CPU Coolers - Deepcool GAMMAXX 400, Intel Stock Cooler, Hyper 212 Evo
* Motherboard - Asus Prime Z370
* RAM - 2 x Ripjaws V 8gb
* Storage - Crucial MX300 1TB SSD
* Case - NZXT S340 Elite
* Fans - Aer RGB 120mm, 140mm
* Graphics Card - Asus Geforce 1070
* Power Supply - Corsair TX550M
* Other Accessories - NZXT Hue+ and Deepcool Fanhub

Equipment used:

* Non-static workbench
* A Phillips screwdriver
* Pliers (I can't remember if I used this but anyways)


### Step 1: Connecting Basic System

The first step in building the computer is assembling the core components on the motherboard. This allows us to check whether our parts are faulty or incompatible. It will allow us to boot up the initial system and to check that everything posts.

To install these: First remove the motherbox from its protective casing and lay it on a non-static workbench. The makeshift workbench used in the picture is simply the motherboard box. Check the motherboard for any obvious defects such as bent socket pins before installing the components. To install the CPU: Open up the CPU cover and remove the CPU from its box, avoiding touching sensitive areas. Align the CPU so that it is correctly oriented with the CPU socket, using the bottom-left triangle for reference. Gently place the CPU into the socket and close it.
Next, open the latches for the RAM slots and push in the RAM sticks according to the optimal layout in the motherboard manual. Press down firmly until the latches snap back up.
