### General Information

Topic:* The relationship between physical, virtual and abstract computing components*
Research Question: *How do physical and virtual subsystems combine to form an optimal programming environment?*

Goal: My goal is to provide the programming community with tools to improve development through a custom environment comprised of customised hardware, a customised operating system and a custom programming language.

Global Context: Scientific and technical innovation
For my global context I was originally split between doing *personal and cultural expression* and *scientific and technical innovation*. I had considered doing 'metacognition and abstract thinking' since programming falls under abstract thinking. However, I realised that this context didn't encompass my entire project but rather just a small subsection. After this, I looked at the Scientific and Technical Innovation context since Computer (Technology) Science (scientific) fits under the context. From here, I chose the models/systems/processes subcategory since it best matched my topic.

### Questions
*27 Jan 2018*

- What will my outcome or product look like?

The outcome of my project will be a specialized programming environment/setup in both hardware and software.

> * Parts (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc)
> * Phillips Screwdriver
> * Thermal Paste

> Linux Distribution 
> * GNU/Linux Coreutils
> * Linux Kernel
> * Git Version Control
> * A window manager / tile manager
> * Package Manager alC

> Programming Language 
> * Lexer
> * Parser Generator
> * Compiler

- What techniques/approaches will I use?

> * Abstraction 
> * Generics
> * Modular Programming
> * Extensibility
> * The Unix Philosophy

- What type of information will I include?

- How will I present the information?

- Will I include visuals?

- Do I need to consider any copyright or intellectual property issues? â–ª Who is the audience?

> GNU/Linux and its deriatives are automatically under the GNU Public License, which is a copyleft license. This license places a large emphasis on **freedom** (free as in speech) and power to the the user. It entails that all source code must be made somewhat available to the user, so that the user may modify however they decide to. Apart from these requirements, there aren't really any issues that I need to consider. 
> 
> The audience, as in the spirit of GNU/Linux, is anyone who wishes to empower themselves and use *free* software.

- How will I get feedback?

> I can get surface level feedback by asking people around me to try the system. However to get deeper feedback, I'd have to mostly rely on my own experience and other people who may decide to go throw the hassle of installing a new operating system. It'd be relatively easy to get feedback for the programming language since it should be easy to install.
